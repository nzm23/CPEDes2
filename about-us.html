                    <p class="plm-description">
                        Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) is the first and only chartered 
                        and autonomous university funded by a city government. It was created 
                        by the Congress of the Philippines by virtue of Republic Act No. 4196 
                        or “An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the
                        University of City of Manila” on June 19, 1965. PLM is the first local 
                        government-funded tertiary institution that offered tuition-free 
                        education. PLM also carries the distinction of being the first tertiary 
                        institution to have a Filipino official name, which is why people use 
                        “Pamantasan” to refer to PLM. The word “pamantasan” was derived from the 
                        Filipino term “pantas” or wise person. The university stands on historic 
                        grounds.
